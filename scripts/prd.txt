# Space Colony Defense - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision
Space Colony Defense is an accessible wave-based space shooter with resource management elements, built in Godot 4. The game combines fast-paced Space Invaders-style combat with strategic resource management and building construction, designed with accessibility as a core feature for visually impaired players.

### 1.2 Target Audience
- Primary: Visually impaired gamers seeking accessible action games
- Secondary: General gaming audience interested in wave-based shooters with strategy elements
- Tertiary: Accessibility advocates and inclusive gaming communities

### 1.3 Core Value Proposition
The first fully accessible wave-based shooter that provides equal gameplay experience through comprehensive audio feedback, screen reader integration, and keyboard-only controls, while maintaining engaging gameplay for all players.

## 2. Core Game Mechanics

### 2.1 Combat System
- Player controls a turret that moves horizontally at the bottom of the screen
- Enemies descend from the top in waves with increasing difficulty
- Turret shoots projectiles upward to destroy enemies
- Enemy types: Basic Invaders, Armored Ships, Swarmers, Destroyers, Bosses
- Collision detection between projectiles and enemies
- Colony health system - enemies that reach the bottom damage the colony

### 2.2 Resource Management
- Three resource types: Energy, Metal, Food
- Resources obtained from defeated enemies and building production
- Energy: Powers turret upgrades and shields, generated by Solar Panels
- Metal: Used for repairs and construction, obtained from Metal Extractors
- Food: Maintains colony efficiency, produced by Farms
- Resource costs for all building construction and colony repairs

### 2.3 Building System
- Five building types with distinct functions:
  - Solar Panel: Generates energy over time
  - Metal Extractor: Produces metal, consumes energy
  - Farm: Produces food, consumes energy
  - Shield Generator: Charges turret shields, consumes energy
  - Missile Silo: Creates missiles for special attacks, consumes energy and metal
- Buildings have upgrade levels (1-3) with increased efficiency
- Limited building slots force strategic decisions

### 2.4 Wave Progression
- Waves increase in difficulty with more enemies and new types
- Boss battles every 5 waves with unique mechanics
- Tech points awarded for wave completion
- Management phase between waves for building and upgrades
