# Game Title: Space Colony Defense
## Concept Overview
Space Colony Defense combines the fast-paced, wave-based shooting of Space Invaders with resource management inspired by strategy games like Stardew Valley or Factorio. You’re a lone commander defending a fledgling space colony on an alien planet from waves of descending alien ships. Between waves, you manage resources like energy, metal, and food to upgrade your defenses, repair your colony, and survive increasingly tough invasions.

## Core Gameplay Loop
### Combat Phase (Space Invaders Style)  
Alien ships descend from the top of the screen in formations, firing projectiles.
You control a mobile turret at the bottom, moving left/right and shooting upward.
Destroy all enemies in a wave to progress to the Management Phase.
Some aliens drop resources (e.g., energy cells, scrap metal) when defeated.
### Management Phase (Resource Management)  
A timer pauses the invasion, giving you time to manage your colony.
Use collected resources to:
Repair your turret (takes damage from enemy hits).
Build or upgrade colony structures (e.g., solar panels for energy, farms for food).
Craft special weapons (e.g., missiles, shields) for the next wave.
Balance resources carefully—overbuilding might leave you defenseless, while hoarding might delay critical upgrades.
### Progression  
Each wave gets harder: faster enemies, new enemy types (e.g., shielded ships, kamikaze drones), and bosses every 5 waves.
Unlock new tech (e.g., laser turrets, resource drones) by surviving longer.

## Key Mechanics
### Combat Mechanics
Turret Movement: Classic left/right movement with a primary laser cannon.
Special Weapons: Craftable one-time-use items (e.g., EMP blast to stun enemies, missile barrage for AoE damage). Limited by resource costs.
Shields: Temporary defense that depletes with hits, rechargeable with energy.
Enemy Variety: 
Basic Invaders: Slow, weak, drop energy.
Armored Ships: Tankier, drop metal.
Swarmers: Fast, low HP, overwhelm in numbers.
Bosses: Unique patterns (e.g., a mothership that spawns minions).

### Resource Management Mechanics
Resources:
Energy: Powers turret upgrades and shields. Gained from solar panels or enemy drops.
Metal: Used for repairs and building. Salvaged from defeated ships.
Food: Keeps your colony alive; low food reduces turret speed (starving crew!).
Buildings:
Solar Panels: Generate energy over time.
Scrap Forge: Converts metal into turret parts or weapons.
Hydroponic Farm: Produces food slowly.
Storage: Increases resource caps.
Trade-offs: Limited building slots force tough choices (e.g., more energy or more firepower?).

## Colony Health
Your colony has a health bar. Enemy projectiles that hit the ground damage it.
If colony health reaches zero, game over. Repair it during Management Phase with metal.

## Visuals and Theme
Art Style: Retro pixel art like Space Invaders, but with glowing neon effects for a modern twist.
Setting: A barren alien planet with your tiny colony at the bottom—think domes, pipes, and blinking lights. The sky darkens as waves progress, signaling tougher enemies.
Sound: 8-bit chiptunes with pulsing beats during combat, calming ambient tracks during management.

## Example Scenario
### Wave 3 Begins:  
You’ve got a basic turret, 50 energy, 20 metal, and 10 food.
10 Basic Invaders and 2 Armored Ships descend. You shoot down 8, taking 2 hits to your shield. Two shots slip through, damaging your colony (80/100 HP left).
Loot: +20 energy, +10 metal.

### #### Management Phase  
Options:
Repair colony (20 metal) to restore HP.
Build a solar panel (30 metal, 10 energy) for more energy next wave.
Craft a missile (20 energy, 10 metal) for Wave 4.
You choose to repair the colony and save the rest, hoping to farm more resources next wave.

### Wave 4:  
Now facing Swarmers. Your turret’s slower (low food), but you scrape by. Time to rethink your strategy!

## Win Condition & Replayability
### Win: Survive 20 waves to establish a self-sustaining colony, ending with a massive boss fight (e.g., an alien dreadnought).
### Replayability 
Random enemy patterns and resource drops.
Unlockable turret skins and colony themes.
Hard mode with limited resources or permadeath.



## 1. Making the Game Accessible to Blind and Visually Impaired Players
To ensure Space Colony Defense is playable without relying solely on visuals, we’ll integrate audio cues, haptic feedback (where applicable), and clear control schemes. Accessibility is about conveying the same information through non-visual means, so here’s how we do it:

### Audio Design
#### Enemy Positioning  
Each enemy type has a distinct sound (e.g., Basic Invaders hum low, Swarmers buzz high-pitched, Armored Ships clank metallically).
Stereo sound pans left-to-right based on the enemy’s horizontal position on-screen. If a Swarmer is far left, its buzz comes mostly from the left speaker/headphone.
Pitch or volume increases as enemies descend closer to your turret, signaling urgency.
#### Turret Actions  
Moving left/right: A soft “click” or sliding sound with directional panning.
Shooting: A sharp “pew” sound, with a reload beep if ammo/energy is low.
Special Weapons: Unique audio signatures (e.g., a rising whine for an EMP, a loud boom for a missile).
#### Resource and Colony Status  
Ambient background tones shift based on colony health (e.g., calm hum at full health, discordant static when low).
Voice announcements or chimes report resource gains/losses (e.g., “+10 energy” in a robotic voice, or a bell for metal drops).
### #### Management Phase  
A narrated menu system: “Press 1 to repair colony, 20 metal required. Current metal: 30.” Options cycle with distinct tones for selection.

### Controls
#### Simplified Inputs  
Keyboard/gamepad-friendly: Arrow keys or joystick for turret movement, one button to shoot, numbered keys (1-4) for special weapons or menu choices.
No need for precise aiming—shots automatically target the nearest enemy above, guided by audio cues.
#### Haptic Feedback  
If played with a controller, vibrations signal hits to your turret, enemy proximity, or resource drops (e.g., short pulse for energy, longer for metal).

### Game State Feedback
#### Real-Time Narration  
A toggleable voice describes critical events: “Wave 5 starting. 12 enemies approaching. Colony health at 70%.”
Alerts for danger: “Enemy nearing base!” or “Shield down!”
#### Pause and Query  
Players can pause and “query” the state (e.g., press Q to hear “Energy: 40, Metal: 15, Food: 5, Turret HP: 80%”).

### Testing and Options
Offer adjustable audio settings (volume, narration speed) and a tutorial mode with guided examples (e.g., “Move left to hear the Swarmer shift”).
Collaborate with accessibility communities for feedback during development.

With these changes, the game becomes a tense audio-driven experience where players “hear” the battlefield and manage their colony through sound and touch, preserving the Space Invaders vibe and resource juggling.

2. Making ### Progression Fit a Roguelike Structure
To transform Space Colony Defense into a roguelike, we’ll introduce permadeath, randomized runs, and meta-progression that tracks wins/losses, encouraging replayability. Each run is a fresh start with persistent unlocks or upgrades that carry over. Here’s the plan:

### Roguelike Core Mechanics
#### Run-Based Gameplay  
Start each run with a basic turret, minimal resources (e.g., 20 energy, 10 metal, 5 food), and a small colony (100 HP).
Goal: Survive as many waves as possible. No fixed “20-wave win”—instead, waves escalate infinitely until you lose (colony HP hits 0) or choose to “retreat” (banking your progress).
#### Randomization  
Enemy waves vary each run: Different mixes of enemy types, speeds, and spawn patterns.
Resource drops are randomized (e.g., Wave 1 might drop 30 energy one run, 10 metal the next).
“Events” occur mid-run (e.g., “Meteor Shower: +20 metal but -30 colony HP” or “Solar Flare: Double energy production this wave”).
#### Permadeath  
Lose your colony, and the run ends. You start over with a new planet and reset resources/buildings.

Meta-### Progression
#### Run Tracking (Galactic Log)  
A persistent log tracks each run: waves survived, enemies killed, resources collected, and cause of death (e.g., “Run 7: Died to Boss Wave 12, 245 enemies defeated”).
Stats unlock achievements or titles (e.g., “Scrap King” for collecting 500 metal across runs).
#### Persistent Upgrades (Tech Points)  
Earn Tech Points based on performance (e.g., 1 point per wave survived, bonus for milestones like defeating a boss).
Spend points between runs on permanent unlocks in a Tech Tree:
Tier 1: Start with +10 energy (5 points), faster turret movement (10 points).
Tier 2: Unlock missile crafting (15 points), +50 colony HP (20 points).
Tier 3: Start with a solar panel (30 points), laser turret option (40 points).
Upgrades are balanced so early runs are tough but get easier with investment.
#### Colony Themes  
Cosmetic unlocks (e.g., “Lunar Base” or “Jungle Outpost”) based on total waves survived across runs. These don’t affect gameplay but add flavor and audio variety (e.g., jungle bird chirps).

### Run Modifiers
#### Relics Rare drops mid-run that persist until death (e.g., “Energy Core: +5 energy per wave” or “Rusty Plating: +20% turret durability”). Randomly offered, max 3 per run.
#### Curses Optional challenges for bonus Tech Points (e.g., “Starving Crew: No food drops, +50% points” or “Overrun: Double enemy spawns, +100% points”).

### Win/Loss Impact
#### Loss Encourages experimentation. “Oh, I overbuilt farms and ran out of metal—next time, I’ll prioritize weapons.”
#### Win (Retreat) If you retreat (e.g., after Wave 15), you bank extra Tech Points (+10% of total earned) and get a “Successful Evacuation” log entry.
#### Endgame After unlocking enough tech (e.g., 200 points), an optional “Final Stand” mode unlocks—a brutal, endless gauntlet with a leaderboard for longest survival.

### Tying It Together
Accessibility + Roguelike: Audio cues double as run feedback (e.g., a triumphant fanfare for retreating, a somber drone for defeat). Randomized enemy sounds and events keep blind players engaged across runs.
### Example Run  
Run 1: Survive 8 waves, die to Swarmers, earn 10 Tech Points. Unlock +10 energy.
Run 2: Start with 30 energy, find an Energy Core relic, retreat at Wave 12 with 18 points. Unlock missile crafting.
Galactic Log: “Run 2: Evacuated Wave 12, 152 enemies, +18 Tech Points.”
