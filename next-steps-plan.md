Next Steps Implementation Plan for Space Colony Defense

1. Management Phase Implementation with Integrated Accessibility
------------------------------------
• Create cli/game/management.py with built-in audio feedback:
  def management_menu(game_state: GameState, audio: AudioService) -> None:
      # Announce current state
      audio.play_narration(f"Colony HP: {game_state.colony.hp}, Metal: {game_state.resources.metal}")
      
      # Present options with audio cues
      audio.play_narration("Available actions:")
      audio.play_narration("1: Repair Colony - 20 metal")
      audio.play_narration("2: Build Structure")
      audio.play_narration("3: Craft Special Weapon")
      
      # Handle input with audio feedback
      if user_input == "1":
          if game_state.colony.repair(game_state.resources):
              audio.play_sound(SoundEffect.ACTION_SUCCESS)
              audio.play_narration("Colony repaired")
          else:
              audio.play_sound(SoundEffect.ACTION_FAIL)
              audio.play_narration("Not enough metal")

2. Building System with Audio Integration
----------------------------------------
• Implement building mechanics in cli/game/buildings.py:
  class Building:
      def __init__(self, type: BuildingType, audio: AudioService):
          self.type = type
          self.audio = audio
      
      def construct(self, resources: Resources) -> bool:
          if self.check_resources(resources):
              self.audio.play_sound(SoundEffect.CONSTRUCTION_START)
              self.audio.play_narration(f"Building {self.type.name}")
              # Construction logic
              self.audio.play_sound(SoundEffect.CONSTRUCTION_COMPLETE)
              return True
          self.audio.play_narration("Insufficient resources")
          return False

3. Resource System Enhancements
------------------------------
• Update GameState with audio-integrated resource management:
  def update_resources(self, delta: Resources, audio: AudioService) -> None:
      if delta.energy != 0:
          self.resources.energy += delta.energy
          audio.play_sound(SoundEffect.RESOURCE_CHANGE)
          audio.play_narration(f"Energy {'+' if delta.energy > 0 else ''}{delta.energy}")
      # Similar for metal and food

4. Testing Strategy
------------------
• Create tests/test_management.py to verify both functionality and accessibility:
  def test_management_menu_announces_state():
      # Test that opening menu triggers correct audio narration
  
  def test_building_construction_provides_audio_feedback():
      # Test building system's audio cues
  
  def test_resource_updates_trigger_audio():
      # Verify resource changes produce appropriate sounds

Next Steps Overview:
-------------------
1. Implement management phase with integrated audio feedback
2. Add building system with accessibility built-in
3. Enhance resource system with audio cues
4. Write tests that verify both functionality and accessibility features

Each feature will be developed with accessibility as a core component, not an add-on. Audio feedback will be immediate and informative, helping players understand game state changes as they happen.
