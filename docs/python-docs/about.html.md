# About this documentation¶
Python’s documentation is generated from reStructuredText sources using Sphinx, a documentation generator originally created for Python and now maintained as an independent project.
Development of the documentation and its toolchain is an entirely volunteer effort, just like Python itself. If you want to contribute, please take a look at the Dealing with Bugs page for information on how to do so. New volunteers are always welcome!
Many thanks go to:
  * Fred L. Drake, Jr., the creator of the original Python documentation toolset and author of much of the content;
  * the Docutils project for creating reStructuredText and the Docutils suite;
  * Fredrik Lundh for his Alternative Python Reference project from which Sphinx got many good ideas.


## Contributors to the Python documentation¶
Many people have contributed to the Python language, the Python standard library, and the Python documentation. See Misc/ACKS in the Python source distribution for a partial list of contributors.
It is only with the input and contributions of the Python community that Python has such wonderful documentation – Thank You!
