pygame constants
This module contains various constants used by pygame. Its contents are automatically placed in the pygame module namespace. However, an application can use `pygame.locals` to include only the pygame constants with a `from pygame.locals import *`.
Detailed descriptions of the various constants can be found throughout the pygame documentation. Here are the locations of some of them.
>   * The `pygame.display`pygame module to control the display window and screen module contains flags like `FULLSCREEN` used by `pygame.display.set_mode()`Initialize a window or screen for display.
>   * The `pygame.event`pygame module for interacting with events and queues module contains the various event types.
>   * The `pygame.key`pygame module to work with the keyboard module lists the keyboard constants and modifiers (`K_`* and `MOD_`*) relating to the `key` and `mod` attributes of the `KEYDOWN` and `KEYUP` events.
>   * The `pygame.time`pygame module for monitoring time module defines `TIMER_RESOLUTION`.
